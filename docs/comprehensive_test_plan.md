# Comprehensive Test Plan with Prioritization

This document provides a detailed test plan for the Next Gen Job Portal application with clear prioritization to guide implementation. It combines specific test cases with a strategic approach to ensure critical functionality is tested first while allowing for reactive testing as issues are discovered.

## Priority Levels

Tests are categorized by priority:

- **P0**: Critical functionality that must work for the app to be usable (implement immediately)
- **P1**: Important features that significantly impact user experience (implement soon)
- **P2**: Secondary features that enhance the app but aren't critical (implement as needed)
- **P3**: Nice-to-have features that can be tested later (implement when time permits)

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with P0 tests**: Focus on critical functionality first
2. **Add tests when fixing bugs**: Write tests that reproduce bugs as they're discovered
3. **Implement P1 tests**: Add tests for important features as they're developed
4. **Add P2 and P3 tests**: Implement as time permits or when issues arise in these areas

## Test Automation

1. **Unit Tests**: Implement for business logic, models, and services
2. **Widget Tests**: Create for UI components and screens
3. **Integration Tests**: Develop for critical user flows
4. **Manual Testing**: Use for exploratory testing and edge cases

## Reporting and Tracking

1. Track test coverage with regular reports
2. Document bugs found during testing
3. Prioritize fixes based on severity and impact
4. Maintain a regression test suite for fixed issues

# Activity Log

## Rules and Guidelines

1. **Documentation Rules:**
   - Every action taken must be recorded in this file with a timestamp for future reference or sharing.
   - Use clear, concise language with proper formatting (bullet points, code blocks, etc.).
   - Include both what was done and why it was done to provide context.
   - Document all errors encountered and how they were resolved.
   - For significant changes, include before/after comparisons when relevant.

2. **Code Quality Rules:**
   - Follow SOLID principles in all code changes:
     - **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class should have only one reason to change.
     - **O**pen/Closed: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
     - **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
     - **I**nterface Segregation: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use.
     - **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
   - Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to eliminate code duplication.
   - Follow CRED design principles for UI components:
     - **C**larity: UI elements should be clear and intuitive.
     - **R**eliability: Components should work consistently across devices and platforms.
     - **E**fficiency: UI should be optimized for performance and user flow.
     - **D**urability: Design should be resilient to content changes and future updates.

3. **Testing Rules:**
   - Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:
     - Write tests before implementing features (Red-Green-Refactor cycle).
     - Start with failing tests (Red).
     - Implement the minimum code to make tests pass (Green).
     - Refactor code while keeping tests passing (Refactor).
   - Ensure all tests are independent and don't rely on other tests.
   - Mock external dependencies to isolate the component being tested.
   - Test both happy paths and edge cases/error conditions.
   - Maintain a minimum test coverage threshold of 30%.
   - Run the full test suite locally before pushing changes.
   - Document test failures and their resolutions in this log.

4. **Git Workflow Rules:**
   - Use descriptive commit messages with prefixes (feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, refactor:, etc.).
   - Run linting and tests locally before committing.
   - Keep commits focused on a single logical change.
   - Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable.
   - Create separate branches for features, fixes, and refactoring.
   - Regularly pull from the main branch to avoid merge conflicts.

5. **Performance Rules:**
   - Optimize images and assets before adding them to the project.
   - Use const constructors for widgets that don't change.
   - Implement proper state management to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
   - Profile the app regularly to identify performance bottlenecks.
   - Document performance improvements with metrics when possible.

6. **NeoPop Design Rules:**
   - Follow NeoPop design principles consistently across the app.
   - Use the neopop package (v1.0.2) for UI components.
   - Maintain consistent elevation, shadows, and depth across components.
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility.
   - Document any custom NeoPop implementations or extensions.

## [2024-08-14]
- Task: Reviewed logging implementation in the project
  - **Issue Description**:
    - Needed to verify if proper logging is being implemented throughout the codebase
    - Needed to check if activity logs are being maintained correctly

  - **Investigation Process**:
    - Examined the LoggerService class in lib/core/services/logger_service.dart
    - Reviewed logging_rules.md in the docs folder
    - Checked how logging is being used across different modules
    - Identified files that might be missing proper logging
    - Looked for inconsistencies in logging implementation
    - Examined activity_log.md and action_log_augment.txt

  - **Findings**:
    - The project has a well-structured LoggerService using the logger package
    - Comprehensive logging_rules.md document outlines best practices
    - Most error handling includes proper logging with error objects and stack traces
    - Some areas for improvement:
      - StorageService and ThemeController don't include logging
      - Auth middleware classes don't include logging
      - Some catch blocks don't include proper error logging
      - Inconsistent use of stack traces in error logging
    - Activity logging is properly set up with:
      - docs/activity_log.md for project activities
      - action_log_augment.txt for Augment Code actions
      - Pre-push hooks to enforce activity log updates

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Proper logging is essential for debugging and monitoring
    - Activity logs provide valuable context for future development
    - Automated enforcement of logging practices helps maintain consistency
    - Both technical logging (for debugging) and activity logging (for knowledge sharing) are important

- Task: Fixed authentication to work across Android, iOS, and web platforms
  - **Issue Description**:
    - Authentication was disabled for web platform
    - Google Sign-In was not properly implemented
    - Firebase configuration in web/index.html was redundant and outdated
    - The implementation had unnecessary complexity
    - Dependency conflicts between Google Sign-In and Firebase packages

  - **Changes Made**:
    - Removed web platform restrictions in AuthService methods
    - Removed the Google Sign-In package completely to avoid dependency conflicts
    - Used Firebase Auth directly for Google Sign-In on all platforms
    - Removed redundant Firebase initialization from web/index.html
    - Simplified the AuthService implementation
    - Fixed the signOut method to handle web platform properly

  - **Benefits**:
    - Authentication now works consistently across all platforms
    - Simplified codebase with less redundancy
    - Improved error handling and logging
    - Better user experience with working authentication on all platforms
    - Eliminated dependency conflicts by using Firebase Auth directly
    - Reduced the number of dependencies in the project

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Firebase Web SDK should be initialized through the firebase_core package
    - Platform-specific code should be isolated and clearly marked
    - Firebase Auth provides native methods for Google Sign-In that work across platforms
    - Proper error handling is essential for authentication flows
    - Sometimes removing a dependency is better than trying to make it compatible

## [2025-04-29]
- Task: Refactor LoginView based on CRED Design Evaluation
  - **Issue Description**:
    - The LoginView needed updates to better align with CRED design principles, improve responsiveness, and enhance visual hierarchy based on a provided evaluation.

  - **Attempted Solutions**:
    1. Searched for `CustomNeoPopButton` as recommended, but the widget was not found in the codebase.
    2. Attempted to add `shimmer: true` to the primary `NeoPopButton` as suggested by the evaluation and documentation.

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Refactored `lib/app/modules/auth/views/login_view.dart`:
      - Replaced fixed `SizedBox` heights with relative spacing using `LayoutBuilder` and `constraints.maxHeight`.
      - Styled `TextField`s (email, password, and in the forgot password dialog) according to `neopop_style_guide.md` (fill color, border radius, border colors, padding).
      - Set `depth` (8 for primary, 5 for secondary) and `parentColor` on `NeoPopButton` widgets.
      - Removed the `shimmer` parameter from `NeoPopButton` as it caused a compile error (parameter not defined in the package).
      - Increased font weight for the screen title, "Forgot Password?", and "Sign Up" links to improve hierarchy.
      - Used `AppTheme` colors for consistency.

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Always verify widget parameters against the actual package implementation, as documentation might be outdated or inaccurate (e.g., `shimmer` parameter in `NeoPopButton`).
    - `LayoutBuilder` is effective for creating responsive spacing relative to the available screen dimensions.
    - Consistent styling across the main view and dialogs improves user experience.
    - If a recommended custom component (`CustomNeoPopButton`) doesn't exist, adapt using the available base components.

- Task: Update CI/CD Configuration and Fix Code Coverage Issues
  - **Issue Description**:
    - CI build failing due to low code coverage (36.8% vs. required 85%)
    - Flutter version in GitHub workflows needed updating
    - SDK version requirement in pubspec.yaml needed adjustment for compatibility

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - The pre-commit and pre-push hooks were not checking code coverage before allowing commits to be pushed
    - Existing tests were not comprehensive enough to achieve the required 85% coverage
    - Many files in the auth module, core theme, storage service, middleware, and routes had low or no test coverage

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Updated Flutter version in GitHub workflows from 3.16.0/3.22.2 to 3.29.3
    - Changed SDK requirement in pubspec.yaml from ">=3.6.0 <4.0.0" to ">=3.2.0 <4.0.0" for compatibility
    - Enhanced pre-push hook to check code coverage before pushing:
      - Added code to run tests with coverage and verify minimum 85% coverage
      - Added helpful error messages with instructions for generating coverage reports
    - Created a plan to improve test coverage for:
      - Auth module (models, services, controllers, views)
      - Core theme files
      - Storage service files
      - Middleware files
      - Routes files
      - Logger service

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Always run code coverage checks locally before pushing changes
    - Maintain comprehensive tests for all code, especially generated code
    - Include code coverage checks in pre-push hooks to catch issues early
    - Keep CI configuration in sync with local development environment

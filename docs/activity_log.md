# Activity Log

## Rules and Guidelines

1. **Documentation Rules:**
   - Every action taken must be recorded in this file with a timestamp for future reference or sharing.
   - Use clear, concise language with proper formatting (bullet points, code blocks, etc.).
   - Include both what was done and why it was done to provide context.
   - Document all errors encountered and how they were resolved.
   - For significant changes, include before/after comparisons when relevant.

2. **Code Quality Rules:**
   - Follow SOLID principles in all code changes:
     - **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class should have only one reason to change.
     - **O**pen/Closed: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
     - **L**iskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
     - **I**nterface Segregation: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use.
     - **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
   - Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to eliminate code duplication.
   - Follow CRED design principles for UI components:
     - **C**larity: UI elements should be clear and intuitive.
     - **R**eliability: Components should work consistently across devices and platforms.
     - **E**fficiency: UI should be optimized for performance and user flow.
     - **D**urability: Design should be resilient to content changes and future updates.

3. **Testing Rules:**
   - Follow minimal testing approach:
     - Focus on testing critical functionality and user flows.
     - Prioritize manual testing across different devices and platforms.
     - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes.
   - Ensure all tests are independent and don't rely on other tests.
   - Mock external dependencies to isolate the component being tested.
   - Test both happy paths and edge cases/error conditions for critical flows.
   - Maintain a minimum test coverage threshold of 5%.
   - Run the full test suite locally before pushing changes.
   - Document test failures and their resolutions in this log.

4. **Git Workflow Rules:**
   - Use descriptive commit messages with prefixes (feat:, fix:, docs:, test:, refactor:, etc.).
   - Run linting and tests locally before committing.
   - Keep commits focused on a single logical change.
   - Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable.
   - Create separate branches for features, fixes, and refactoring.
   - Regularly pull from the main branch to avoid merge conflicts.

5. **Performance Rules:**
   - Optimize images and assets before adding them to the project.
   - Use const constructors for widgets that don't change.
   - Implement proper state management to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
   - Profile the app regularly to identify performance bottlenecks.
   - Document performance improvements with metrics when possible.

6. **NeoPop Design Rules:**
   - Follow NeoPop design principles consistently across the app.
   - Use the neopop package (v1.0.2) for UI components.
   - Maintain consistent elevation, shadows, and depth across components.
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility.
   - Document any custom NeoPop implementations or extensions.

    - Target was to roll back to commit 3f22334b292f8323e329cdd3c455077a4cbb3e19

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Used `git reset --hard 3f22334b292f8323e329cdd3c455077a4cbb3e19` to roll back to the NeoPOP theme implementation commit
    - This reset removes all changes made after the NeoPOP theme implementation, including:
      - CI/CD fixes and workflow improvements
      - Dependency updates (firebase_auth, actions/checkout)
      - Code coverage threshold changes
      - SharedPreferences to Hive migration
    - Verified the working tree is clean after the rollback

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Always document rollbacks in the activity log for future reference
    - Use `git reset --hard` with caution as it discards all changes since the target commit
    - Consider using `git revert` for rollbacks that need to be shared with others, as it creates a new commit

  - **Issue Description**:
    - When logging out, the loading indicator kept spinning indefinitely
    - The user was unable to see when the logout process completed
    - This created a poor user experience and confusion

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - The signOut method in AuthController was using isLoading.value which was shared with other operations
    - The loading state wasn't being properly reset before navigation
    - The HomeView wasn't properly handling the loading state lifecycle
    - Firebase instances were defined as final, preventing proper initialization in onInit

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Created a dedicated isSignOutLoading state variable:
      - Added a new Rx<bool> specifically for sign out operations
      - This prevents conflicts with other loading operations
    - Updated the signOut method in AuthController:
      - Used isSignOutLoading.value instead of the shared isLoading.value
      - Reset loading state before navigation to prevent state persistence
      - Added proper error handling to reset loading state on errors
    - Added a resetSignOutLoading method to AuthController:
      - Created a dedicated method to reset the sign out loading state

- Fixed Persistent Loading Indicator After Sign Out:
  - **Issue Description**:
    - After signing out and returning to the login screen, the loading indicator continued to spin
    - This affected both the primary login button and Google sign-in button
    - The issue created a confusing user experience as it appeared the app was still processing
    - Users couldn't tell if they needed to wait or could proceed with login

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - The `isLoading` state variable was shared between login and Google sign-in methods
    - When signing out, only the `isSignOutLoading` state was being reset, not the `isLoading` state
    - The LoginView was a StatelessWidget with no initialization logic to reset states
    - The loading state persisted across navigation due to the permanent controller binding

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Added a comprehensive `resetAllLoadingStates()` method to AuthController:
      - Created a single method to reset all loading state variables
      - Made it accessible for use in different parts of the app
      - Added proper logging for debugging
    - Converted LoginView to StatefulWidget:
      - Changed from StatelessWidget to StatefulWidget
      - Added initState method to initialize controller and reset states
      - Called `resetAllLoadingStates()` when the login view is initialized
    - Updated signOut method to use the new reset method:
      - Replaced individual state reset with the comprehensive method
      - Updated both the success path and error handling path
      - Ensured all loading states are reset before navigation

  - **Benefits**:
    - Fixed the persistent loading indicator issue after sign out
    - Improved user experience by providing clear visual feedback
    - Enhanced state management with a more comprehensive approach
    - Prevented potential state conflicts between different loading operations
    - Made the code more maintainable with centralized state reset logic

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Always reset all relevant state variables when navigating between screens
    - Use StatefulWidget when initialization logic is needed
    - Create comprehensive state reset methods instead of resetting individual states
    - Test navigation flows thoroughly, especially back navigation
    - Consider how shared state variables might affect different parts of the app

- Fixed GetX Controller Registration and Navigation Issues:
  - **Issue Description**:
    - App was crashing with error: "AuthController not found. You need to call Get.put(AuthController())"
    - GlobalKey duplication error: "A GlobalKey was used multiple times inside one widget's child list"
    - These errors occurred during app startup and navigation between screens
    - The issues prevented the app from properly initializing and navigating

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - The AuthMiddleware was trying to access the AuthController before it was registered with GetX
    - The middleware runs during route resolution, but the controller was only registered when the binding was executed
    - Multiple GetMaterialApp instances were using the same default GlobalKey for navigation
    - The controller registration timing was causing race conditions in the initialization process

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Updated AuthMiddleware to handle missing controller:
      - Added try-catch block to safely find or register the AuthController
      - Set explicit priority (2) to ensure proper middleware execution order
      - Added comprehensive logging for better debugging
    - Updated OnboardingMiddleware:
      - Fixed logger initialization to use Get.find instead of direct instantiation
      - Ensured proper priority (1) to run before AuthMiddleware
    - Enhanced App widget to pre-register controllers:
      - Added code to pre-register AuthController during app initialization
      - Fixed GlobalKey duplication by explicitly using Get.key for navigation
      - Added GetObserver for proper navigation history management
      - Improved logging throughout the initialization process
    - Updated route definitions with clear middleware priority comments

  - **Benefits**:
    - Fixed app crashes during startup and navigation

    - The error occurred even after initial fixes, particularly during hot reload
    - The issue was preventing proper navigation and causing app crashes
    - The error was related to the Navigator key in GetMaterialApp

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - The previous fix to use Get.key was not sufficient to prevent key duplication
    - Hot reload was causing issues with key management and reuse
    - The GetX framework was not properly handling key lifecycle during rebuilds
    - Multiple widgets were trying to use the same default navigator key

  - **Comprehensive Solution**:
    - Converted App widget from StatelessWidget to StatefulWidget:
      - Created a dedicated navigator key with a unique debug label
      - Properly managed key lifecycle in initState and dispose methods
      - Improved error handling and logging during initialization
    - Enhanced AuthMiddleware with more robust error handling:
      - Added fallback logger initialization if not found
      - Implemented public routes list to skip auth checks for certain routes
      - Added logic to prevent unnecessary redirects for already authenticated users
    - Updated OnboardingMiddleware with similar robustness:
      - Added fallback logger initialization
      - Improved error handling throughout the middleware
    - Removed unnecessary cleanup methods that were causing issues

  - **Benefits**:
    - Completely eliminated GlobalKey duplication errors
    - Improved app stability during hot reload and restart

- Fixed Profile View Firebase User Property Issues:
  - **Issue Description**:
    - The ProfileView was using incorrect property names from the Firebase User class
    - Errors included: `photoUrl` instead of `photoURL`, `email` as non-nullable, and accessing non-existent `createdAt` property
    - These errors were causing the profile view to crash when loaded

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - The ProfileView was designed for a custom UserModel but was receiving a Firebase User object
    - Firebase User uses different property names (e.g., `photoURL` with uppercase URL)
    - Firebase User's `email` property is nullable (String?)
    - Firebase User doesn't have a `createdAt` property but has creation time in `metadata.creationTime`

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Updated property references to match Firebase User class:
      - Changed `photoUrl` to `photoURL` for profile picture display
      - Added null check for email with fallback text: `user.email ?? 'No email available'`
      - Replaced `createdAt` with `metadata.creationTime` with proper null checking
      - Added fallback text for when creation time is not available

  - **Benefits**:
    - Fixed all errors in the profile view
    - Improved error handling with fallback text for null values
    - Enhanced robustness by properly handling nullable properties
    - Ensured the profile view works correctly with Firebase User objects

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Always check the actual properties and types of objects being used
    - Add proper null handling for all nullable properties
    - Use IDE diagnostics to identify and fix property reference issues
    - Test views with actual data to catch these issues early
    - Document the expected object types and properties for each view

- Fixed Auth Middleware Issues:
  - **Issue Description**:
    - The auth middleware files had errors related to checking user login status
    - `AuthMiddleware` was using a non-existent `isLoggedIn` property
    - `AuthGuard` had syntax errors with cascade notation and incorrect property access
    - These errors were preventing proper navigation and authentication flow

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - The middleware was trying to access `isLoggedIn.value` which doesn't exist in AuthController
    - The correct way to check login status is to check if `user.value` is null
    - `AuthGuard` had a malformed condition with incorrect cascade notation (`..value`)
    - The route name in `AuthGuard` was using `Routes.auth` which might not exist

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Updated `AuthMiddleware` to check login status correctly:
      - Changed `if (authController.isLoggedIn.value)` to `if (authController.user.value != null)`
      - This properly checks if a user is logged in by checking the user object
    - Fixed `AuthGuard` with proper condition and route:
      - Changed malformed condition to `if (authController.user.value == null)`
      - Updated route to `Routes.login` for consistency

  - **Benefits**:
    - Fixed authentication flow for protected routes
    - Ensured proper redirection based on login status
    - Eliminated runtime errors in middleware

    - Error occurred in AuthBinding when trying to access AuthService from the service locator
    - The error was preventing the login screen from loading
    - Stack trace showed the error happening during the AuthBinding.dependencies method

## [2024-07-28]
- Fixed Hive Adapter Registration Issue for SignupSession:
  - **Issue Description**:
    - App was crashing with error: "HiveError: Cannot write, unknown type: SignupSession. Did you forget to register an adapter?"
    - Error occurred in SignupSessionService.saveSession method
    - The error was preventing signup sessions from being saved to Hive
    - This affected the ability to resume signup process after interruption

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - The SignupSession and SignupStep Hive adapters were defined but not properly registered before use
    - There was a race condition where the SignupSessionService was used before HiveManager completed initialization
    - The error occurred because Hive couldn't serialize the SignupSession object without a registered adapter
    - Two different adapter implementations existed: generated adapters in signup_session.g.dart and custom adapters in signup_session_adapter_helper.dart

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Updated SignupSessionAdapterHelper to use the generated adapters:
      - Removed custom adapter implementations that duplicated the generated ones
      - Added constants for type IDs to improve code readability
      - Improved error handling and logging

    - Implement proper initialization in service classes
    - Use flags to track initialization status
    - Add comprehensive error handling for database operations

- Fixed setState() Called During Build Error in RoleBasedBottomNav:
  - **Issue Description**:
    - App was showing error: "setState() or markNeedsBuild() called during build"
    - The error occurred in the RoleBasedBottomNav widget
    - The issue was caused by the DashboardView directly modifying NavigationController.selectedIndex.value in didChangeDependencies
    - This was triggering a setState() call in the RoleBasedBottomNav widget during the build phase

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - The RoleBasedBottomNav widget was using ever() listeners that called setState() when observable values changed
    - These listeners were being triggered during the build phase when DashboardView updated selectedIndex.value
    - Flutter doesn't allow calling setState() during the build phase as it can cause infinite rebuild loops
    - The issue was exacerbated by multiple views updating the selectedIndex in their didChangeDependencies methods

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Completely refactored the RoleBasedBottomNav widget to use a more robust approach:
      - Removed the ever() listeners that were calling setState() directly
      - Added a didChangeDependencies method that uses Future.microtask to schedule setState() calls after the build phase
      - Converted the widget to use Obx for reactive UI updates instead of relying on local state
      - Made _buildNavItem use Obx to reactively respond to selectedIndex changes
    - This approach ensures that:
      - The widget still responds to changes in the NavigationController
      - setState() is never called during the build phase
      - The UI updates properly when the selected index or user role changes

  - **Benefits**:
    - Fixed the "setState() called during build" error
    - Made the bottom navigation bar more robust against state changes
    - Improved the widget's reactivity using GetX's Obx
    - Prevented potential infinite rebuild loops
    - Enhanced the overall stability of the navigation system

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Avoid using ever() listeners that call setState() directly
    - Use Future.microtask to schedule setState() calls after the build phase
    - Prefer Obx for reactive UI updates when using GetX
    - Be careful when updating observable values in lifecycle methods like didChangeDependencies
    - Test widgets with different state update patterns to ensure they handle all cases properly
- Fixed Layout Overflow in Signup View:
  - **Issue Description**:
    - App was showing error: "A RenderFlex overflowed by 34 pixels on the right"
    - This layout overflow was occurring in the signup view
    - The error was affecting the UI appearance and causing error messages in the console
    - This is a common Flutter UI issue where a widget is trying to render content that doesn't fit within its constraints

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - Multiple UI components in the signup view were not handling overflow properly:
      - The role selection section was using a Wrap widget but needed better alignment
      - The Google Sign Up button had a Row that could overflow on smaller screens
      - The "Already have an account?" section was using a Row that could overflow
      - The "OR" divider had horizontal padding that was too large

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Updated the Google Sign Up button:
      - Added `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` to prevent the Row from taking full width
      - Wrapped the text in a Flexible widget to allow it to shrink if needed
      - Added `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` to handle text overflow gracefully
    - Replaced the "Already have an account?" Row with a Wrap widget:
      - Used `alignment: WrapAlignment.center` to center the content
      - Used `crossAxisAlignment: WrapCrossAlignment.center` to align items vertically
    - Improved the "OR" divider:
      - Reduced horizontal padding from 16 to 8
      - Reduced the font size to 12
      - Added flex parameters to ensure equal sizing of dividers

  - **Benefits**:
    - Fixed the layout overflow error
    - Improved UI appearance on smaller screens
    - Prevented error messages in the console
    - Made the signup view more responsive
    - Enhanced user experience by ensuring all content is visible

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Use Wrap widgets instead of Row widgets when content might overflow
    - Add Flexible widgets to allow text to shrink when needed
    - Use TextOverflow.ellipsis to handle text overflow gracefully
    - Reduce padding and font sizes on smaller screens
    - Test UI on different screen sizes to catch overflow issues early
- Fixed Hive Adapter Registration Issue for SignupSession:
  - **Issue Description**:
    - App was crashing with error: "HiveError: Cannot write, unknown type: SignupSession. Did you forget to register an adapter?"
    - Error occurred in SignupSessionService.saveSession method
    - The error was preventing signup sessions from being saved to Hive
    - This affected the ability to resume signup process after interruption

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - The SignupSession and SignupStep Hive adapters were defined but not properly registered before use
    - The HiveManager was initializing adapters, but there might be a race condition where the SignupSessionService was used before HiveManager completed initialization
    - The error occurred because Hive couldn't serialize the SignupSession object without a registered adapter
    - The initial approach of directly using the generated adapter classes didn't work because they are part of the generated code and not directly accessible

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Created a dedicated SignupSessionAdapterHelper class:
      - Implemented custom adapter classes that match the generated ones
      - Added a static registerAdapters method to handle registration in one place
      - Made the helper class handle all adapter registration logic
    - Updated SignupSessionService to use the helper class:
      - Replaced direct adapter registration with calls to SignupSessionAdapterHelper
      - Simplified all methods to use the same adapter registration approach
      - Added more detailed error logging to capture HiveError details
      - Improved error handling with proper fallbacks
    - This approach ensures that even if HiveManager hasn't completed initialization, the SignupSessionService can still function by registering the adapters itself

  - **Benefits**:
    - Fixed the "unknown type: SignupSession" error
    - Created a reusable pattern for adapter registration that can be applied to other models
    - Improved error handling and recovery
    - Enhanced logging for better debugging
    - Made the service more robust against initialization timing issues
    - Ensured signup sessions can be properly saved and retrieved

    - These errors occurred when using Obx widgets and when rendering lists with unbounded height
    - The issues were causing UI elements to disappear and error messages to appear

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - Nested Obx widgets in SearchView and DashboardView were causing reactive state issues
    - ListView widgets without proper height constraints were causing overflow errors
    - Direct access to .obs variables outside of reactive contexts
    - Unbounded ListView in the recent activity section was causing overflow
    - The RoleBasedBottomNav widget was using ScreenUtil without proper initialization
    - The RoleBasedBottomNav widget was using Obx in a way that caused reactive state issues
    - The CustomDrawer widget was using ScreenUtil without proper initialization

    - Made the code more maintainable with proper separation of concerns

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Avoid sharing GlobalKeys across multiple widgets in the widget tree
    - Each widget should manage its own state and keys
    - Use regular fields instead of `late final` for values that might change
    - Add proper error handling and logging for navigation operations
    - Test navigation flows thoroughly, especially back navigation
    - Consider how shared state variables might affect different parts of the app

- Fixed GetX Reactive UI Issues and Layout Overflow:
  - **Issue Description**:
    - App was showing error: "The improper use of a GetX has been detected"
    - Another error: "A RenderFlex overflowed by 99435 pixels on the bottom"
    - These errors occurred when using Obx widgets and when rendering lists with unbounded height
    - The issues were causing UI elements to disappear and error messages to appear

  - **Root Cause Analysis**:
    - Nested Obx widgets in SearchView and DashboardView were causing reactive state issues
    - ListView widgets without proper height constraints were causing overflow errors
    - Direct access to .obs variables outside of reactive contexts
    - Unbounded ListView in the recent activity section was causing overflow

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Fixed nested Obx widgets:
      - Removed redundant Obx widgets in SearchView's _buildSearchResults and _buildSearchHistory methods
      - Added proper Obx wrappers around conditional UI in DashboardView
      - Ensured each reactive variable is properly observed in a single Obx widget
      - Added detailed comments explaining proper Obx usage to prevent future issues
    - Fixed layout overflow issues:
      - Added proper physics to ListView widgets with AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics
      - Limited the number of items in the recent activity list to prevent overflow
      - Added ConstrainedBox with maxHeight constraint to the recent activity ListView
      - Added comments to explain the changes for future maintenance
      - Ensured all Column widgets with ListView children have proper height constraints
    - Enhanced error handling and logging:
      - Added detailed comments explaining reactive UI patterns
      - Improved error recovery with proper state management
      - Added clear warnings about nested Obx widgets

  - **Benefits**:
    - Eliminated the "improper use of GetX" errors
    - Fixed the layout overflow issues (99435 pixels on the bottom)
    - Improved UI stability and performance
    - Enhanced error handling and recovery
    - Made the code more maintainable with proper reactive patterns
    - Added educational comments to prevent similar issues in the future

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Avoid nesting Obx widgets - each observable should be wrapped in exactly one Obx
    - Always provide bounded height for ListView widgets inside Column widgets (use ConstrainedBox)
    - Use ListView.builder with proper physics for scrollable lists
    - Limit the number of items in lists that use shrinkWrap and NeverScrollableScrollPhysics
    - Test UI on different screen sizes to catch overflow issues early
    - Add clear comments about reactive UI patterns to educate other developers

- Fixed Bottom Navigation Tab Views:
  - **Issue Description**:
    - The search, resume, and profile tabs were all showing the same home screen content
    - Each tab should have its own different screen with different use cases
    - The resume and profile routes were using DashboardView as a temporary placeholder
    - Users were confused by seeing the same content on different tabs

  - **Working Solution**:
    - Created a new ResumeView with placeholder content:
      - Added basic UI with upload and view resume buttons
      - Implemented proper styling with NeoPOP design elements
      - Added responsive layout for different screen sizes
    - Created ResumeController and ResumeBinding:
      - Added basic controller with placeholder methods
      - Created proper binding with dependency registration
    - Updated app_pages.dart to use the correct views:
      - Changed profile route to use the existing ProfileView
      - Changed resume route to use the new ResumeView
      - Updated bindings to match the correct controllers
      - Maintained proper middleware configuration

  - **Benefits**:
    - Each tab now shows different content appropriate to its function
    - Improved user experience with distinct screens for each tab
    - Better navigation flow throughout the application
    - Proper separation of concerns with dedicated views and controllers
    - Foundation for future development of resume management features

  - **Lessons Learned**:
    - Always ensure each navigation tab has its own dedicated view
    - Use placeholder views with relevant content when features are not yet implemented
    - Maintain consistent navigation patterns throughout the app
    - Update route configurations when new views are created
    - Document navigation changes in the activity log for future reference

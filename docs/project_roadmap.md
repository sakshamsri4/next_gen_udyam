# Next Gen Job Portal Flutter App - Detailed Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
This roadmap outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Next Gen Job Portal Flutter app using GetX for state management, NeoPOP UI library for CRED-inspired design, and Firebase for backend services. The app will be structured as a modular monorepo using Melos, with a focus on rapid development and responsive UI.

The app is an automobile sector-focused job portal that connects employers and job seekers. It features role-based access (employer, employee, admin), company profiles, job posting and application functionality, and a comprehensive admin dashboard for platform management.

## Development Approach
- **Rapid Development**: Focus on building features quickly with minimal testing overhead
- **CRED Design System**: Implement NeoPOP UI components following CRED design principles
- **Responsive UI**: Ensure excellent user experience across Android, iOS, and web platforms
- **GetX CLI**: Use for scaffolding modules and managing state
- **Modular Architecture**: Organize code in feature modules with clear separation of concerns
- **Minimal Testing**: Maintain 5% test coverage for critical functionality

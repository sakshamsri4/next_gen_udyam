# Next Gen Job Portal Flutter App - Detailed Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
This roadmap outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Next Gen Job Portal Flutter app using Test-Driven Development (TDD), GetX for state management, NeoPOP UI library for CRED-inspired design, and Firebase for backend services. The app will be structured as a modular monorepo using Melos.

## Development Approach
- **TDD First**: Write failing tests before implementing features
- **CRED Design System**: Implement NeoPOP UI components following CRED design principles
- **GetX CLI**: Use for scaffolding modules and managing state
- **Modular Architecture**: Organize code in feature modules with clear separation of concerns
- **90%+ Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all modules

## Module-by-Module Implementation Plan

### 1. Initial Setup & Architecture (2-3 days)

**Tasks:**
1. Initialize a Flutter project with Melos for monorepo management
2. Configure GetX CLI and Mason for code generation
3. Set up Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Messaging)
4. Implement the NeoPOP design system with CRED-inspired styling
5. Create the atomic design folder structure
6. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD with test coverage reporting
7. Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

**Implementation Details:**
```bash
# Initialize Melos
flutter pub global activate melos
melos init

# Configure GetX CLI and Mason
dart pub global activate getx_cli
dart pub global activate mason_cli

# Set up Firebase

- Verify module interactions
- Test on real devices when possible

## Design Guidelines

### NeoPOP Implementation
- Use elevated buttons with proper depth
- Apply consistent color palette
- Implement physical feedback on interactions
- Follow CRED design principles for typography and spacing

### Accessibility
- Add semantic labels to all interactive elements
- Ensure sufficient color contrast

## Git Workflow

1. Create feature branches for each module: `feature/auth`, `feature/resume`, etc.
2. Follow conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, etc.
3. Require code reviews before merging
4. Update activity_log.md after completing each module
5. Maintain README.md with setup instructions and features

## CI/CD Pipeline

1. On PR:
   - Run formatting checks
   - Run static analysis
   - Run tests with coverage reporting
   - Require 90%+ coverage

2. On merge to main:
   - Deploy to Firebase Hosting
   - Run smoke tests
   - Tag release version

This roadmap provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the Next Gen Job Portal app using TDD, GetX, NeoPOP UI, and CRED design principles. Each module has clear requirements, testing guidelines, and design specifications to ensure a high-quality final product.

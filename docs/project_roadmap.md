# Next Gen Job Portal Flutter App - Detailed Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
This roadmap outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Next Gen Job Portal Flutter app using GetX for state management, NeoPOP UI library for CRED-inspired design, and Firebase for backend services. The app will be structured as a modular monorepo using Melos, with a focus on rapid development and responsive UI.

## Updated Approach (2024-07-28)
We've integrated a third-party job portal app (JobsFlutterApp) to accelerate development. The updated approach focuses on:
- **Functionality First**: Implement core functionality from the third-party app before enhancing UI
- **Dual User Roles**: Support both employee and employer functionality from day one
- **Incremental UI Enhancement**: Start with functional screens, then gradually apply NeoPOP styling
- **API Integration**: Use the existing API integration from the third-party app initially

## Development Approach
- **Rapid Development**: Focus on building features quickly with minimal testing overhead
- **CRED Design System**: Implement NeoPOP UI components following CRED design principles
- **Responsive UI**: Ensure excellent user experience across Android, iOS, and web platforms
- **GetX CLI**: Use for scaffolding modules and managing state
- **Modular Architecture**: Organize code in feature modules with clear separation of concerns
- **Minimal Testing**: Maintain 5% test coverage for critical functionality

## Module-by-Module Implementation Plan

5. Create the atomic design folder structure
6. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD with test coverage reporting
7. Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

**Implementation Details:**
```bash
# Initialize Melos
flutter pub global activate melos
melos init

# Configure GetX CLI and Mason
dart pub global activate getx_cli
dart pub global activate mason_cli

# Set up Firebase

### Backend Integration

**IMPORTANT: We will use our Firebase backend, not the third-party API**
- We'll adopt the UI components and structure from the third-party app
- All API calls will be redirected to our Firebase backend
- The third-party app originally used these endpoints (for reference only):
  - Base URL: `https://kasmtj.pythonanywhere.com`
  - Authentication: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/company_signup`, `/api/auth/customer_signup`
  - Jobs: `/api/jobs/`
  - Companies: `/api/companies/`
  - Search: `/api/companies/search`
  - Applications: `/api/applications/`

### Integration Strategy

1. **Adapt UI Components While Using Firebase Backend**
   - Replace all API calls with Firebase services
   - Implement Firebase Authentication for both user types
   - Use Firestore for job listings, applications, and user profiles
   - Keep the dual user role system (employee/employer)

2. **Enhance UI with NeoPOP**
   - Gradually replace UI components with NeoPOP styled versions
   - Maintain responsive design across all screen sizes
   - Ensure consistent theme throughout the app

3. **Add Missing Features**
   - Implement resume upload functionality
   - Add dashboard with analytics
   - Enhance employer job management

## Git Workflow

1. Create feature branches for each integration phase: `feature/third-party-integration`, `feature/auth`, etc.
2. Follow conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, etc.
3. Require code reviews before merging
4. Update activity_log.md after completing each phase
5. Maintain README.md with setup instructions and features

## CI/CD Pipeline

1. On PR:
   - Run formatting checks
   - Run static analysis
   - Run minimal tests for critical functionality
   - Require 5% coverage

2. On merge to main:
   - Deploy to Firebase Hosting
   - Run basic smoke tests
   - Tag release version

This revised roadmap provides a practical guide for integrating the third-party JobsFlutterApp while enhancing it with NeoPOP UI and additional features. The focus is on getting a functional app with both employee and employer capabilities first, then gradually improving the UI and adding more features.

# Third-Party Integration Todo List

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process for integrating UI components and functionality from the third-party JobsFlutterApp into our existing Next Gen Job Portal application. We'll maintain our Firebase backend while leveraging the UI components and user flows from the third-party app.

## Integration Process

For each module, we'll follow this process:
1. **Analysis**: Examine the third-party implementation
2. **Adaptation**: Create adapter controllers to work with our Firebase backend
3. **UI Integration**: Integrate the UI components
4. **Testing**: Test the functionality with our backend

### 5. Home Module Enhancements
- [ ] Analyze third-party HomeView and controller
- [ ] Enhance existing home screen with featured jobs section
- [ ] Add recent jobs section
- [ ] Implement job categories/chips for quick filtering
- [ ] Test with Firebase backend

### 6. UI Components Integration
- [ ] Integrate custom job card component
- [ ] Integrate custom avatar component
- [ ] Integrate custom text field component
- [ ] Integrate custom button component
- [ ] Integrate shimmer loading effects
- [ ] Create a UI component library for reuse

- [ ] Implement drawer menu with additional options
- [ ] Update routes to support new screens
- [ ] Test navigation flow

## Implementation Priority

We'll implement the modules in this order:

1. **Profile Module** - Provides essential user information display
2. **Job Details Module** - Core functionality for viewing and applying to jobs
3. **Saved Jobs Module** - Important user engagement feature
4. **Search Module Enhancements** - Improves job discovery
5. **Home Module Enhancements** - Better first-time user experience
6. **UI Components Integration** - Consistent UI across the app
7. **Navigation Improvements** - Better app navigation

## Technical Requirements

### Firebase Integration
- Ensure all data operations use our Firebase backend
- Implement proper security rules for Firestore collections
- Set up Firebase Storage for profile images and company logos
- Use Firebase Authentication for user identification

### Code Organization
- Keep third-party integration code in a separate directory structure
- Create adapter controllers to bridge UI and Firebase
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document all integration points

### Testing
- Test each module with real Firebase data
- Verify all CRUD operations work correctly
- Test edge cases (empty data, loading states, errors)
- Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes

## Documentation
- Document the integration process for each module
- Create usage examples for integrated components
- Update the project roadmap to reflect integration progress
- Maintain activity log with integration milestones

## Completion Criteria
A module is considered successfully integrated when:
1. It uses our Firebase backend for all data operations
2. The UI components are properly styled and responsive
3. All functionality works as expected
4. It's properly tested with different scenarios
5. It's documented in the project documentation

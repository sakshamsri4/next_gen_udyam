# Third-Party Integration Todo List

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process for extracting UI components and assets from the third-party JobsFlutterApp and integrating them into our existing Next Gen Job Portal application. We'll use our Firebase backend for data and Supabase for storage, while leveraging only the UI components and assets from the third-party app.

## Integration Process

For each module, we'll follow this process:
1. **Extract**: Copy only the necessary UI components and assets from the third-party app
2. **Adapt**: Modify the UI components to work with our Firebase/Supabase backend
3. **Apply CRED Design**: Transform the UI components to follow CRED design principles from `docs/cred_design_guide.md`
4. **Implement**: Create our own controllers and services that connect to Firebase/Supabase
5. **Test**: Verify the functionality works with our backend
6. **Clean Up**: Remove any unused third-party code or dependencies

## Modules to Integrate

### 1. UI Components and Assets

- [ ] Extract and adapt core UI components with CRED design principles:
  - [ ] Copy custom button styles and widgets and apply CRED button design (elevated, pill-shaped)
  - [ ] Extract text field designs and input widgets and apply CRED typography guidelines
  - [ ] Copy card designs and layouts and apply CRED card design (physical appearance, elevation)
  - [ ] Extract avatar and image components and apply CRED styling
  - [ ] Copy loading animations and shimmer effects and adapt to CRED motion principles
  - [ ] Replace color schemes with CRED color system from the design guide
  - [ ] Apply CRED typography guidelines to all text elements
  - [ ] Copy icons and vector assets and adapt to CRED icon style
- [ ] Create our own component library with these CRED-styled components
- [ ] Connect components to our theme system based on CRED design guide
- [ ] Implement animations following CRED motion guidelines
- [ ] Test components with different screen sizes while maintaining CRED design language

### 2. Profile Screens

#### Customer Profile Screen
- [ ] Extract customer profile screen UI only
- [ ] Copy profile layout, cards, and form elements
- [ ] Create our own ProfileController connected to Firebase
- [ ] Implement profile image upload with Supabase storage
- [ ] Connect UI to our data models and controllers
- [ ] Test with Firebase backend

#### Company Profile Screen
- [ ] Extract company profile screen UI only
- [ ] Copy company profile layout and design elements
- [ ] Create our own CompanyProfileController connected to Firebase
- [ ] Implement company logo upload with Supabase storage
- [ ] Connect UI to our data models and controllers
- [ ] Test with Firebase backend

### 3. Job Details Screen

- [x] Extract job details screen UI only
- [x] Copy layout, cards, and visual elements
- [x] Create our own JobDetailsController connected to Firebase
- [x] Implement job application form UI
- [x] Connect UI to our data models and controllers
- [x] Test with Firebase backend

### 4. Saved Jobs Screen

- [ ] Extract saved jobs screen UI only
- [ ] Copy list view, cards, and empty state designs
- [ ] Create our own SavedJobsController connected to Firebase
- [ ] Implement save/unsave functionality with Firebase
- [ ] Connect UI to our data models and controllers
- [ ] Test with Firebase backend

### 5. Search Screen

- [ ] Extract search screen UI elements only
- [ ] Copy search bar, filters, and results layout
- [ ] Create our own SearchController connected to Firebase
- [ ] Implement Firestore-based search functionality
- [ ] Connect UI to our data models and controllers
- [ ] Test with Firebase backend

### 6. Home Screen Elements

- [ ] Extract home screen UI components only
- [ ] Copy featured jobs carousel design
- [ ] Extract recent jobs list layout
- [ ] Copy category chips and filters design
- [ ] Create our own HomeController connected to Firebase
- [ ] Connect UI to our data models and controllers
- [ ] Test with Firebase backend

### 7. Navigation Elements

- [ ] Extract bottom navigation bar design
- [ ] Copy drawer menu layout and animations
- [ ] Extract tab navigation components
- [ ] Create our own navigation system connected to our routes
- [ ] Test navigation flow with our screens

## Implementation Priority

We'll implement the modules in this order:

1. **UI Components and Assets** - Create a foundation for all screens
2. **Home Screen Elements** - Establish the main entry point
3. **Job Details Screen** - Core functionality for viewing jobs
4. **Search Screen** - Essential for job discovery
5. **Profile Screens** - User and company information
6. **Saved Jobs Screen** - User engagement feature
7. **Navigation Elements** - Tie everything together

## Technical Requirements

### Firebase and Supabase Integration
- Use Firebase for all data operations (Firestore, Authentication)
- Use Supabase for file storage (profile images, company logos)
- Implement proper security rules for both services
- Create clear separation between UI and backend logic

### Extraction Process
- Copy only the necessary UI components and assets
- Do not copy any business logic or API calls
- Remove all references to the third-party backend
- Adapt components to work with our data models

### Code Organization
- Create a clean component library with extracted UI elements
- Organize screens in our existing module structure
- Use our own controllers and services for business logic
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Do not keep any original third-party files

### Testing
- Test each UI component with our Firebase/Supabase backend
- Verify all functionality works correctly
- Test edge cases (empty data, loading states, errors)
- Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes

## Documentation
- Document which UI components were extracted from the third-party app
- Create usage examples for our component library
- Update the project roadmap to reflect integration progress
- Maintain activity log with integration milestones

## Completion Criteria
A module is considered successfully integrated when:
1. The UI components are extracted and adapted to our app
2. CRED design principles from `docs/cred_design_guide.md` are applied to all UI elements
3. It uses our Firebase backend for all data operations
4. It uses Supabase for file storage where needed
5. All functionality works as expected
6. It's properly tested with different scenarios
7. Responsive design is maintained across all screen sizes
8. Animations and interactions follow CRED motion guidelines
9. No third-party code or files remain in the final implementation

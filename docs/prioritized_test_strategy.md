# Prioritized Test Strategy

This document outlines a prioritized testing strategy for the Next Gen Job Portal application, focusing on a reactive approach that balances development speed with code quality. It complements the existing comprehensive test plan by providing clear priorities and implementation guidelines.

## Testing Philosophy

The strategy follows a "reactive testing" approach where:

1. **Focus on critical paths first**: Test the most important user flows and functionality
2. **Write tests when fixing bugs**: Add tests for bugs as they're discovered to prevent regression
3. **Prioritize by impact**: Allocate testing resources based on feature importance and risk
4. **Balance speed and quality**: Maintain development velocity while ensuring core functionality works correctly

## Priority Levels

Tests are categorized by priority:

- **P0**: Must-have tests for critical functionality (write these first)
- **P1**: Important tests for core features (write these second)
- **P2**: Useful tests for secondary features (write as needed)
- **P3**: Nice-to-have tests (write if time permits)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (P0)

Focus on the core infrastructure that everything else depends on:

| Component | Test Focus | Priority | Implementation Approach |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Authentication | Login/signup flows, session management | P0 | Unit test AuthController and AuthService, integration test for login/signup flows |
| Role Management | Role selection, role-based access | P0 | Unit test RoleMiddleware and role-based navigation |
| Data Models | Serialization/deserialization | P0 | Unit test model classes with sample data |
| Storage | Hive initialization, data persistence | P0 | Unit test StorageService with mock Hive |

### Phase 2: Core User Flows (P0-P1)

Focus on the main user journeys for the employee role:

| Feature | Test Focus | Priority | Implementation Approach |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Job Search | Search functionality, filters | P0 | Unit test search logic, widget test for UI |
| Job Application | Apply flow, validation | P0 | Integration test for full application flow |
| Profile Management | Edit profile, validation | P1 | Unit test validation, widget test for UI |
| Saved Jobs | Save/unsave functionality | P1 | Unit test saved jobs service |

### Phase 3: Extended Functionality (P1-P2)

Focus on employer features and additional employee features:

| Feature | Test Focus | Priority | Implementation Approach |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Job Posting | Create/edit jobs | P1 | Integration test for job creation flow |
| Application Management | View/manage applications | P1 | Widget test for application list/details |
| Company Profile | Edit company profile | P2 | Widget test for company profile form |
| Resume Management | Upload/manage resumes | P2 | Integration test for resume upload |

### Phase 4: Edge Cases and UI (P2-P3)

Focus on error handling, edge cases, and UI components:

| Feature | Test Focus | Priority | Implementation Approach |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Error Handling | Network errors, Firebase errors | P2 | Unit test error handling logic |
| UI Components | Buttons, cards, forms | P2 | Widget tests for reusable components |
| Empty States | No results, no saved jobs | P3 | Widget tests for empty state UI |
| Loading States | Loading indicators | P3 | Widget tests for loading UI |

## Reactive Testing Implementation

### When to Write Tests

1. **When implementing critical features**: Write tests for P0 features as they're implemented
2. **When fixing bugs**: Write tests that reproduce the bug and verify the fix
3. **When refactoring code**: Write tests to ensure behavior doesn't change
4. **When adding new features**: Write tests for core functionality

### Test Types by Priority

| Priority | Unit Tests | Widget Tests | Integration Tests |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| P0 | Core business logic, data models, services | Critical UI components | Main user flows (login, signup, job application) |
| P1 | Feature-specific logic, validation | Feature-specific UI | Secondary flows (profile editing, job posting) |
| P2 | Edge cases, error handling | Secondary UI components | Edge case flows |
| P3 | Helper functions, utilities | Visual elements, animations | Performance, stress testing |

## Bug-Driven Testing Examples

### Example 1: Authentication Error

**Bug**: Users can't log in with valid credentials when the app is offline.

**Test to Add**:
```dart
test('login should handle offline mode gracefully', () async {
  // Arrange: Set up offline mode
  when(() => connectivityService.isConnected).thenReturn(false);
  
  // Act: Attempt login
  final result = await authController.login('test@example.com', 'password');
  
  // Assert: Should show offline error, not authentication error
  expect(result, isFalse);
  expect(authController.errorMessage.value, contains('offline'));
});
```

### Example 2: Job Application Bug

**Bug**: Job application fails silently when the resume is too large.

**Test to Add**:
```dart
test('apply for job should validate resume size', () async {
  // Arrange: Set up a large resume file
  final largeResume = MockFile();
  when(() => largeResume.lengthSync()).thenReturn(11 * 1024 * 1024); // 11MB
  
  // Act: Attempt to apply with large resume
  final result = await jobApplicationController.applyWithResume(
    jobId: 'test_job',
    resume: largeResume,
  );
  
  // Assert: Should fail with appropriate error
  expect(result, isFalse);
  expect(jobApplicationController.errorMessage.value, contains('size'));
});
```

## Test File Organization

Organize test files to mirror the structure of the lib directory:

```
test/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── modules/
  │   │   ├── auth/
  │   │   │   ├── controllers/
  │   │   │   │   └── auth_controller_test.dart
  │   │   │   ├── services/
  │   │   │   │   └── auth_service_test.dart
  │   │   │   └── views/
  │   │   │       └── login_view_test.dart
  │   │   └── ...
  │   └── ...
  ├── core/
  │   ├── services/
  │   │   └── ...
  │   └── ...
  └── widgets/
      └── ...
```

## Test Helpers and Utilities

Leverage existing test helpers and consider adding these additional utilities:

1. **MockFirebaseAuth**: For simulating Firebase authentication
2. **FakeFirestore**: For simulating Firestore database
3. **NetworkSimulator**: For testing different network conditions
4. **TestDataGenerator**: For generating test data for jobs, users, etc.

## Continuous Integration

Set up CI to run tests automatically:

1. **On Pull Requests**: Run all P0 and P1 tests
2. **Nightly**: Run all tests including P2 and P3
3. **Before Release**: Run all tests and generate coverage report

## Conclusion

This prioritized testing strategy allows for a balanced approach that:

1. Ensures critical functionality works correctly
2. Prevents regression of fixed bugs
3. Maintains development velocity
4. Focuses testing efforts where they provide the most value

By following this strategy, you can build a robust test suite incrementally while continuing to develop new features at a rapid pace.

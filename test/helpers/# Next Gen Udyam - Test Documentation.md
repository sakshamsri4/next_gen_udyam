# Next Gen Udyam - Test Documentation

## Testing Strategy

This document outlines our testing approach for the Next Gen Udyam project. We follow a balanced strategy that combines proactive testing of critical paths with reactive testing when issues are encountered.

### Testing Principles

1. **Critical Path Coverage**: Ensure all main user flows have test coverage
2. **Regression Prevention**: Write tests for all fixed bugs to prevent recurrence
3. **Focus on Integration Points**: Prioritize testing where modules connect
4. **Balanced Scope**: Maintain a practical 5% minimum test coverage while focusing on quality over quantity

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: For isolated functions and methods
- **Widget Tests**: For UI components and screens
- **Integration Tests**: For multi-component workflows
- **Error Case Tests**: For error handling and recovery

## Test Cases
